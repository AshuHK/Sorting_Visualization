# Sorting_Visualization

List sorting visualization made in Python with a GUI 
  - Full GUI application using the Tkinter framework (might crash on Mac)

There are two folders in this repo: 
  - text_based_sorts is for the sorts that are done with the standard Python list and contain the standard code for the sorts 
    - Might also contain additional notes about the sorts 
  - gui_based_sorts contains the GUI for the visualizer that will be used as a tool to help learn the sorting algorithms
